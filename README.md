# Energy-Management-System-for-EV

This program helps you to create Electrical Vehicle charging variables by using genetic algorithm. These values are initial charge level, desired charge level, departure and arrival time of the EV's. 

There are three types of areas which can be choosen at beginning of the program via interface menu. These are household area, commercial area, industrial area. 

Every spesific area have their own constraints seperately so genetic algorithm creates only related data for the given entries.

Then by using mixed integer programming, an optimization process runs. 

This optimization problem might you to optimize customer side prices for charging in three different tarif grid. 

You can follow the related bus load and graph them.

That was a part of my bachelor thesis at Yildiz Technical University Electrical Engineering department. So for any updates and doubts, please contact with me via bakikocabasa@gmail.com
